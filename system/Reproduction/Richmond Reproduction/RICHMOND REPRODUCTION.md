# RICHMOND REPRODUCTION

> Reproduce Richmond County's recorded-instrument corpus in
> `Legal Instruments.db` — every doc id, its recorded details, its image —
> complete, current within minutes, and PROVEN so by the update board.
> Closed COMPLETE and week-audited 2026-08-28. This file is the authority
> for what runs richmond and what "right" looks like; change the lane's
> shape in `fleet.py`, change the rules HERE.

> Three named parts (login 2026-08-28): **THE CYCLE** (the pipeline that
> reproduces), **RICHMOND UPDATE** (the board that tracks it), and
> **RICHMOND AUDIT** (the enumeration safety check — NOT part of the
> cycle; run it whenever you want a proof).

## 1 · THE CYCLE (login's words — this IS richmond reproduction)

**synchronization** — doc ids flow into the db, with the MONITOR (the
probe, every 10 s) live-tracking doc inflow on the day window: a new
filing's id lands within seconds of the county listing it.

**mint** — built into the db logic: the `mint_urls` trigger forms both
urls from the doc id in the same transaction as the insert. The urls are
how rd and pdf navigate. No process, no forgetting.

**rd** — acquires the recorded details and populates them into the row's
cells. In-session only, after the listing page (the grant rule below);
the heal (every 15 min, 30-day window) catches any filing whose detail
lagged its listing. A failed fetch is a RETRY next cycle, never a verdict
(measured 2026-08-28: failed 4 → landed 4 on the following pass).

**pdf** — acquires the image, sends it to the right folder in the store,
and copies the path into the db, with the path / pending / absent logic:

    a real path    the scan, fetched and landed in the store (evidence)
    'pending'      CHECKED - the source itself says the scan is not up
                   yet ("No Image Available At This Time") - re-asked
                   every 5 min until it uploads
    'absent'       CHECKED - determined no image (the url does not show)
    ''             NOT YET CHECKED - the honest todo, never a verdict

`pending` and `absent` are DETERMINATIONS and count as landed; `''` is
the only unlanded state; NULL must never appear.

**keying** — RETIRED 2026-08-27. Columns physically present, nothing
writes them. ⚠ NAMING (login): "richmond sync" the lane IS richmond
reproduction now — the rename (rc_lane → richmond_reproduction) is
DEFERRED to the key-column removal, because renaming a lane with docs
inflowing risks more than it buys. Never reproduce and delete/rename at
the same time.

## 2 · THE CODE (the roster — what richmond reproduction IS)

| piece | file | job |
|---|---|---|
| THE CYCLE | `decoder\rc_lane.py` | the ONLY richmond process: monitor/probe every 10 s (day pages, sync landings) · rd heal every 15 min over a 30-day window · 24 miners (mint asks) · 8 pullers (image fetch + land) · pending recheck every 5 min. Launch: `python fleet.py start sync`. |
| RICHMOND AUDIT | `decoder\richmond_audit.py` | the enumeration safety check, one command (see §5). |
| census sweeper | `decoder\rc_census.py` | the audit's historical baseline: `--run` sweeps the county's whole listed history (resumable); `--report` prints listed/held/void. |
| RICHMOND UPDATE | `Updates\board_truth.py` + `Updates\routine_update.py` | the anchor (landed = total − todo, richmond counted live 60 s) and the row renderer (see §4). |
| roster | `decoder\fleet.py` | the lane's args (`--apply --miners 24 --workers 8`), PAUSED mechanism, singleton guard; Fleet Guard restarts crashed lanes within 5 min. |
| db triggers | in `Legal Instruments.db` | `mint_urls` (the minter) · `key_on_rd` (dormant). |

Retired, never to run beside the lane: rc_live, rc_feed, rc_pdf_pull,
rc_pdf_land, rc_rd_walk (`_archive/richmond_preconsolidation/`). Two
minters double-serve ids — served_ids is per-process.

## 3 · CALIBRATIONS (values + the conditions they were measured under)

- **DRUMROLL RULE**: no pacer, no governor — latency is the only
  governor. Proven 160 concurrent connections, 26 h clean. The ONLY
  safety is stop-on-refusal, and the rd heal stopping says nothing about
  the pdf host (different host, self-authenticating tokens).
- **Pullers = 8** (rc_bench 2026-08-25, single variable: 8 → 28.23
  docs/s · 16 → 18.76 — past the pipe, self-contending). Richmond is
  BANDWIDTH-shaped (~5 MB docs); acris is latency-shaped. Never read one
  lane's rate as evidence about the other.
- **First handshakes staggered** 0.4 s/worker; keep-alive removes every
  later handshake. 160 cold TLS opens in one instant = SSLError across
  the board.
- **THE GRANT RULE** (2026-08-21): a detail unlocks only after THIS
  session fetched the LISTING PAGE the id appears on. A cold detail
  fetch returns HTTP 200 and a 4,212-byte lie. Window → pages →
  details, same session, always.
- **TWO NUMBER NAMESPACES**: internal id (RC_<n>, ours) ≠ instrument
  number (repeats!). Probes must pin the internal id.
- **30-day heal window** = the absent-verdict line: inside it, absent/
  pending are scan-lag, re-asked; outside it we stop asking and an
  un-minted row keeps `''`. 10/10 Friday docs read "absent" and were
  "present" by Monday — first readings are never verdicts.
- **The eject/wifi hold**: park rc_lane + routine_update + board_truth
  in fleet.py PAUSED before pulling D: or losing the network (a lane on
  a dead drive WEDGES silently). Resume = remove the names; the guard
  restarts them.
- Lane restarts are free (drumroll) — richmond stops/starts at full
  speed, unlike acris.

## 4 · RICHMOND UPDATE (the board, fine-tuned to track the cycle)

One row `synchronization | richmond`, proven live 2026-08-28:

- `needed` moves with the filings — board_truth counts richmond's total
  LIVE every 60 s (0.17 s warm) + the ledger delta. The 2026-08-23
  "read the ledger" calibration EXPIRED when rc_lane made the PK's RC_
  range hot; conditions changed, value re-taken.
- `landed` = total − unassigned (index-only, ix_nav_pdf_todo; pending
  counts landed — an assignment is a determination).
- **rate and increase come from THE SAME SUBTRACTION** as landed:
  sync|richmond is deliberately NOT in routine_update's `_CUM_SPEC`
  (removed 2026-08-28 — the `db N` download counter is blind to
  assignment-landings; measured landed +83 while downloads sat flat,
  board printed 0.0/s on a climbing row).
- Kits: 60 s (`now`) + 5 m (`window`); after a flat stretch the window
  re-arms and needs ~4-5 min of movement before a rate prints — honest,
  not a defect.
- Statuses: ACTIVE (a process is pulling) · COMPLETE (landed == needed
  EXACTLY) · STALLED (an error blocks progress) · PENDING (we paused
  ourselves — wifi, eject; `parked` in updates_config.json). Only
  ACTIVE earns an eta.
- Acceptance (seen live at the 16:45 close): landed +1 ticks · eta
  "4 min" → "complete" · ACTIVE → COMPLETE at exact equality. A new
  filing must walk needed+1 → ACTIVE → rd → pending → landed+1 →
  COMPLETE with no hand touching anything.

## 5 · RICHMOND AUDIT (enumeration — a safety check, NOT the pipeline)

login: "enumeration is an audit that isn't part of the cycle, but exists
to check whenever we want to as a match of total doc id in our db vs the
live source."

**THE ENUMERATION LAW (login 2026-08-29), the same at every source:
`BULK BASELINE + LIVE TAIL = TOTAL`.** For richmond the baseline is the
census window sweep (1850 → last swept day) and the tail is the
date-range window to now; for acris it is the Socrata diff plus the CRFN
edge walk. The baseline is complete but stale, the tail live but shallow,
and the ranges must OVERLAP so nothing hides in a seam — richmond's
30-day window deliberately reaches back weeks past the census's last
swept day.
⚠ **AN EMPTY DENOMINATOR IS NEVER A PASS.** `--days 45` exceeded the
county's 30-day window cap, returned a SILENT ZERO, and printed
`county lists 0 ... held 0/0 · MISSING 0` — a "pass" on a window we KNEW
held hundreds of filings. The tool now clamps to 30 days and reports
UNPROVEN when the listing is empty. Re-run at 30 days: county 2,633,
held 2,633/2,633, MISSING 0 — a real PASS.

    python richmond_audit.py [--days 30]

What it proves, in one command, all read-only:
1. **our totals** — RC row count + the zero-states (`rd=''`, `pdf=''`,
   NULL) — sub-second, index-only.
2. **live membership** — fetches the county's OWN listing for the
   trailing window and PK-checks every internal id: `held N/N ·
   MISSING 0` or the missing ids named.
3. **historical baseline** — `rc_census.py --report` accounting
   (listed / held / MISSED / void). The census closed history through
   2026-08-25; the trailing window overlaps it by weeks, so there is no
   seam between baseline and live edge.

PASS = MISSING 0 · MISSED 0 · zero-states 0 (except an honest pdf=''
just-landed tail). PROVEN 2026-08-28: week 08/21..08/28 → county 745,
held 745/745, MISSING 0 (login's independent count: 745 ✓); census
MISSED 0; inflow chain since 08/21 reconciled to zero remainder
(+75,001 backfill close · +105 · +169 · +170 · +112 · +85 live).

## 6 · CLOSED STATE (2026-08-28)

2,502,230 rows · COMPLETE 16:45 · week audit 745/745 · census MISSED 0 ·
~85 fresh filings pending on the recheck · heal residue self-closed
(failed 4 → landed 4). Keying columns dormant, rename deferred to their
removal. Next: the same three names for acris — `acris_reproduction.py`
(the group-entry design, untested) · acris update (the shared board's
acris rows) · acris audit (formalize on close) — then DOB per the
roadmap.
